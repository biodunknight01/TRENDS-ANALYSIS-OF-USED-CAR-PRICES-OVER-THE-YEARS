Coimbatore has the highest total price of used cars (7.5K), followed closely by Mumbai (7.5K) and Kochi (7.3K).
Pune has the lowest total price (4.2K) among the listed locations.
Regional factors, such as demand, supply, or cost of living, might influence these variations.

3. Transmission Type Distribution
The majority of cars have automatic transmission (71.75%), with 5.2K entries.
Manual transmission cars account for 28.25% (2.05K).
This suggests a strong preference for automatic cars in the dataset.

Recommendations:
1. Pricing Strategies
For Dealers:
Focus on selling cars in high-demand locations such as Coimbatore, Mumbai, and Kochi, where the total price of cars is higher. Consider regional price optimizations to capitalize on higher willingness to pay.
Introduce competitive pricing strategies in lower-price locations like Pune to attract more buyers and increase sales volume.
For Buyers:
Explore markets like Pune and Bangalore to find relatively lower-priced cars compared to cities like Coimbatore or Mumbai.

2. Inventory Management
Transmission:
With 71.75% of the dataset showing a preference for automatic transmission, dealers should maintain a higher inventory of automatic cars to meet market demand.
While manual cars are less common, there is still a market for them, especially for cost-sensitive buyers or niche markets.
Fuel Type:
Diesel cars dominate the dataset, indicating strong demand. Dealers should stock more diesel models, especially for high-mileage users or regions where diesel fuel is cheaper.
Petrol cars are also significant, and a balanced inventory of petrol and diesel cars will cater to diverse customer needs.
Promote alternative fuel vehicles (CNG, LPG, electric) in cities where environmental consciousness and government incentives for green vehicles are growing.

3. Marketing and Promotions
Luxury Brands:
High-value brands like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Jaguar have a significant presence. Focus marketing efforts on premium customers through luxury-focused campaigns.
Highlight features like engine power, brand prestige, and resale value to attract buyers for high-end models.
Mileage Efficiency:
Cars with mileage in the range of 13-19 kmpl are most common and have higher prices, indicating customer preference for fuel-efficient models.
Dealers should advertise these mileage brackets as a key selling point for fuel-conscious buyers.

4. Regional Insights
Coimbatore, Mumbai, and Kochi:
These locations have higher aggregate prices, suggesting strong demand or premium car sales. Tailor marketing campaigns to target affluent buyers in these regions.
Lower Demand Regions (Pune):
Implement aggressive discounts or trade-in offers to boost sales. Explore partnerships with local mechanics and finance providers to enhance accessibility.

5. Fuel Type and Green Initiatives
Promote awareness and adoption of electric, CNG, and LPG cars as they are currently underrepresented. Work with manufacturers and policymakers to offer incentives like reduced taxes, subsidies, or zero-interest financing for eco-friendly vehicles.

6. Customer Segmentation
First-Time Owners:
Focus on selling diesel and automatic cars to cater to first-time buyers looking for convenience and reliability.
Provide maintenance packages to ensure retention of these customers for servicing needs.
Cost-Sensitive Customers:
Offer manual transmission cars and older models with reasonable prices in markets like Pune or Bangalore.
High-End Buyers:
Promote premium cars and emphasize value retention, mileage, and brand recognition.

7. Sales Planning
Model-Specific Insights:
Focus on promoting high-priced models such as the Mercedes-Benz GLE Class and Audi Q7 3.0 TDI. These cars can generate more revenue per sale.
Depreciation Awareness:
Use the declining price trend over the years to educate buyers about value depreciation and encourage them to invest in newer used cars (e.g., cars from 2015-2016 with a higher price base).

8. Expand the Alternate Fuel Market
Create partnerships with energy providers to build the infrastructure for electric and CNG vehicles, especially in high-demand urban areas.
Target environmentally conscious buyers by promoting hybrid and electric cars with incentives and showcasing long-term savings.
